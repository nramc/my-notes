# Local Development Essentials

## Testing E-Mail Sending Feature

- [Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org/) is a small, fast, low memory, zero-dependency, multi-platform email testing
  tool & API for developers
- It acts as an SMTP server, provides a modern web interface to view & test captured emails, and includes an API for
  automated integration testing
- [Docker](https://mailpit.axllent.org/docs/install/docker/) with Springboot really useful for local development
- [Rest API](https://mailpit.axllent.org/docs/api-v1/view.html#get-/api/v1/info) really helpful for integration testing

## Testing MongoDB documents

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/products/compatibilities/docker) docker image helps to run docker
  container for local development
- [MongoDB Express](https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express.git) is one of the best tool to visualise MongoDB
  content, and it's really helpful for local development to add/update/remove data from/to MongoDB
