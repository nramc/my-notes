# Email Template

## Freemarker

- [Freemarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/index.html) is one of my favorite template engine for emails
- It provides rich features to manage complex logics using parent-child template formatting
- [Online FreeMarker Template Tester](https://try.freemarker.apache.org/) is really helpful and handy to test your
  templates
- [IntelliJ Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/template-data-languages.html) support developing freemarker
  templates out of the box

## Thymeleaf

- [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/articles/springmail.html) is really handy for simple and lightweight email
  templates
- Thymeleaf and SpringMail is one of the best combination in my opinion
- [IntelliJ Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/thymeleaf.html) supports thymeleaf development out of the box

## Tip

- [Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org/) is email & SMTP testing tool with API, it is really helpful for local
  development
  to run local SMTP server and visualise using builtin UI and can also be used inn unit and integration testing with
  builtin REST API.
