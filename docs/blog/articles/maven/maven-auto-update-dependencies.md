# Automating Maven Dependency Updates

In Java projects, keeping dependencies up to date is crucial for ensuring security, enhancing performance, and
maintaining compatibility. However, managing and updating dependencies manually can be tedious and error-prone.
Fortunately, there are various tools available to automate this process, such as GitHub Dependabot, RenovateBot, the
Maven Versions Plugin, and the OpenRewrite Maven Plugin.

This article explores these tools and how they can help you automate Maven dependency updates efficiently.

**Why Automate Dependency Updates?**

Automating dependency updates brings several advantages:

1. Security Enhancements
    - Fix vulnerabilities automatically by upgrading dependencies.
    - Ensure compliance with security best practices.
2. Stability and Performance
    - Upgrade to stable versions for bug fixes and performance improvements.
    - Avoid breaking changes by controlling updates.
3. CI/CD Integration
    - Automatically update dependencies in a controlled, repeatable manner.
    - Reduce manual maintenance in large-scale projects.

## Dependabot (GitHub)

- [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuring-dependabot-version-updates)
  is an automated tool from GitHub that helps you keep your dependencies up to date by automatically creating pull
  requests.
- Fully integrated with GitHub.
- It supports multiple package managers, including Maven.
- Configure it via `.github/dependabot.yml`:
  ```yaml
    version: 2
    updates:
    - package-ecosystem: "maven"
      directory: "/"
      schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
   ```

## Maven Versions Plugin

- [Maven Versions Plugin](https://www.mojohaus.org/versions/versions-maven-plugin/index.html) helps you check for and
  update Maven dependencies.
- It can be run manually or automated through CI/CD pipelines.
- Works directly within your Maven build lifecycle.
- It can be executed as part of CI workflows.
- It can be configured in the `pom.xml`:
  ```xml
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>versions-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${versions-maven-plugin.version}</version>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ```
- It can be run via the command line or integrated into CI/CD pipelines:
  ```shell
  # To update dependencies to the latest stable release:
  mvn versions:use-latest-releases
  
  # To update dependencies declared using properties:
  mvn versions:update-properties
  
  # To update parent POM version:
  mvn versions:update-parent
    
  # Check for Available Updates Without Applying
  # To display dependency updates:
  mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
  
  # To display plugin updates:
  mvn versions:display-plugin-updates
    
  ```

  enabling developers to effectively eliminate technical debt within their repositories.
- [OpenRewrite Maven Plugin](https://docs.openrewrite.org/maven-plugin/latest/html/index.html) is the fastest way to
  apply OpenRewrite recipes to your code as part of your Maven build.
- [UpgradeDependencyVersion Recipe](https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes/java/dependencies/upgradedependencyversion) is
  a recipe that upgrades dependencies to the latest version.
- Easily integrated into your Maven build process.
- It can be configured in the `pom.xml`:
  ```xml
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${rewrite-maven-plugin.version}</version>
        <configuration>
            <activeRecipes>
                <recipe>com.github.nramc.recipes.UpgradeAllDependencies</recipe>
            </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
    </plugin>
  ```
  ```yaml
  type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
  name: com.github.nramc.recipes.UpgradeAllDependencies
  recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.UpgradeDependencyVersion:
    groupId: "*"          # Upgrade all dependencies
    artifactId: "*"       # Upgrade all dependencies
    newVersion: "latest.release"
  ```
- It can be run via the command line or integrated into CI/CD pipelines:
  ```shell
  # To apply the recipe:
  mvn rewrite:run
  ```
