# Java Application Development: Must-Have Checklist

This article provides a comprehensive checklist to streamline Java application development, covering setup, coding,
testing, and deployment essentials. It serves as a guide for developers to ensure they have all the necessary components
in place for a successful project.

!!! info "Information"

    This checklist is based on my experience and the best practices I have learned over the years. It is not exhaustive, but
    it covers the most important aspects of Java application development. The checklist is divided into several sections,
    each focusing on a specific area of development.

## Project Initialization & Tooling

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-rocket-launch-outline: **Spring Initializr**  
  [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) helps you quickly bootstrap a new Spring Boot project with the right
  dependencies and structure.

- :material-layers-outline: **Clean Architecture**  
  [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) separates
  application concerns into clear layers, improving testability and maintainability.
    - [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/) to enforce architectural rules
    - [Pragmatic Clean Architecture](https://nramc.github.io/my-notes/blog/clean-architecture-developer-journey.html)

- :material-source-branch-check: **Continuous Integration (CI)**  
  Automate testing and validation for every commit and PR by setting up a CI workflow.
    - [Example CI Workflow (ci-build-workflow.yml)](https://github.com/nramc/journey-api/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci-build-workflow.yml)

- :material-rocket-launch: **Continuous Deployment (CD)**  
  Set up CD pipelines to automate QA and production deployments after successful builds.
    - [Example CD Workflow (release-workflow.yml)](https://github.com/nramc/journey-api/blob/main/.github/workflows/release-workflow.yml)
