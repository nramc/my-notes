# WEEKLY VALUATION CHECK & INVESTMENT DECISION

I want you to analyze valuation of the following indices and fund categories and tell me where to invest my ₹5000 weekly
lumpsum.

My options are:

1. Nifty 50 Index Fund
2. Nifty Next 50 Index Fund
3. Nifty Midcap 150 Index Fund
4. Nifty Smallcap 250 Index Fund
5. Nifty LargeMidcap 250 Index Fund
6. Gold ETF
7. Silver ETF

Please do the following:

## 1. Fetch **latest** PE, PB, and Dividend Yield

Retrieve the most recent publicly available valuation metrics for:

- Nifty 50 Index
- Nifty Next 50 Index
- Nifty Midcap 150 Index
- Nifty Smallcap 250 Index
- Nifty LargeMidcap 250 Index
- Gold ETF
- Silver ETF

## 2. Compare current valuation to historical norms

For each index or fund:

- State whether current PE/PB is low, fair, or high
- Compare with its 5-year average (if accessible)
- Mention the valuation trend (rising or falling vs last week)

## 3. Calculate an undervaluation score

Rate each one on this scale:

- Strong Buy (deep undervalued)
- Buy (undervalued)
- Hold (fairly valued)
- Avoid for lumpsum (overvalued)

## 4. Recommendation where to invest my ₹5000 this week

Choose ONE or TWO funds with justification, such as:

- Lower valuation
- Better risk-adjusted entry
- Lower downside risk
- Safer for lumpsum vs SIP
- Market sentiment considerations

## 5. Add a short summary

A simple 1 line summary telling:

- Where valuation is cheap
- Where it is expensive
- Where I should invest my ₹5000
- Any warning signals (overvalued or overheated segments)
