# Developer Workstation Tools

Tools helps developer to improve productivity and simplify running application or services smoothly, conveniently

## Clean as You Code

- [SonarLint](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) Plugin for IDE: Detect bugs and code smells as early as
  possible while you code

## EnvFile: Manage Environment Variables

- [EnvFile](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7861-envfile) allows you to set environment variables for your run
  configurations from one or multiple files
- It supports YAML, JSON and .env formats

## mkcert: Local Trust store for Local Development

- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) A simple zero-config tool to make locally trusted development
  certificates with any names you'd like
- Using certificates from real certificate authorities(CAs) for development can be dangerous or impossible (for hosts
  like example.test, localhost or 127.0.0.1), but self-signed certificates cause trust errors.
- Managing your own CA is the best solution, but usually involves arcane commands, specialized knowledge and manual
  steps.
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) automatically creates and installs a local CA in the system root
  store, and generates locally-trusted certificates.
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) does not automatically configure servers to use the
  certificates, though, that's up to you.

## Design and Document your feature

- [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) IDE plugin helps us to write varies diagrams by writing code for documenting your
  feature
