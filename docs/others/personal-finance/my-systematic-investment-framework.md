# My Systematic Investment Framework

**Review Checklist**:

✅ [Quarterly](#quarterly-review-checklist-3045-minutes) | 
✅ [Annual](#annual-review-checklist-6090-minutes)

## Overview

This document defines **My Systematic Investment Framework**, a structured and rule-based approach to managing my
personal investments in the share market(Indian Equity).

The primary objective of this framework is to support long-term wealth creation while minimizing the impact of emotional
decision-making, short-term market noise, and behavioral biases. All investment decisions are made within a clearly
documented set of principles and rules, ensuring consistency across different market cycles.

This framework serves as a personal investment constitution — a reference system that helps maintain discipline during
both favorable and adverse market conditions. It emphasizes process over prediction, rules over reactions, and
consistency over short-term outcomes.

### Motivation

The motivation behind creating this framework is:

- To help my family and me achieve long-term financial goals through disciplined investing
- To document a clear, rules-based investment approach that can be followed consistently
- To enable family members to understand and adhere to a common investment philosophy
- To make repeatable and well-reasoned investment decisions
- To reduce emotional buying, selling, and market timing errors
- To avoid overtrading, performance chasing, and panic-driven actions
- To balance long-term wealth creation with limited, rule-based tactical flexibility
- To manage risk systematically while pursuing sustainable growth

**Primary Objectives** of This Framework:

* **Primary goal**: Long-term wealth creation with controlled drawdowns
* **Secondary goal**: Avoid emotional decisions during market extremes
* **Tertiary goal**: Transfer knowledge about financial literacy to family members and next generations

### What This Framework Covers

This framework provides guidance on:

- Core investment principles and behavioral rules
- Strategic and tactical asset allocation decisions
- Investment rules across different market capitalization segments
- Risk management and position sizing guidelines
- Portfolio monitoring and review indicators
- Rebalancing methodology and decision triggers
- A centralized reference for all investment-related decisions

### What This Framework Does Not Cover

This framework intentionally does **not** address:

- Specific investment products, securities, or stock selection
- Detailed financial planning, tax planning, or goal quantification
- Day-to-day trading or short-term speculative strategies
- Market predictions or return guarantees
- Get-rich-quick or high-risk trading approaches
- A replacement for professional financial advice

## Core Principles

The following principles form the foundation of My Systematic Investment Framework.
These principles are designed to remain valid across market cycles and are not changed based on recent performance or
market sentiment.

1. **Allocation First**: Asset allocation matters more than fund selection.
2. **Core & Satellite**: Large cap Index funds form the core; all other funds are satellites.
3. **Manage Risk**: Diversify and rebalance; risk is controlled, not chased.
4. **Consistency Wins**: No shortcuts—long-term investing beats timing.
5. **Ignore Noise**: Stick to the plan; avoid decisions based on news or social media.
6. **Investor, Not Trader**: Focus on long-term growth, not short-term trades.
7. **Think Long-Term**: Core portfolio is built for 10+ years. Believe in compounding over time.
8. **Review, Don’t Overreact**: Check regularly but change sparingly.
9. **Discipline Over Timing**: Consistent investing beats market timing. Follow rules, not forecasts.
10. **Keep It Simple**: Simple, clear strategies outperform complex ones.
11. **Mutual Funds Over Stocks**: Use mutual funds rather than picking individual stocks. IMO, stock picking is a
    zero-sum game and not worth the effort for retail investors.
12. **Believe in Compounding**: Compounding is the eighth wonder of the world. Start early, stay invested, and let time
    work its magic.

## Strategic Asset Allocation

Strategic Asset Allocation defines the **default structure of my portfolio**.
It represents how my investments are allocated under normal market conditions and serves as the anchor for all
investment and rebalancing decisions.
This allocation is designed to balance **long-term growth** with **risk control and stability**.

The framework follows a similar **75-25 structure**, which provides a well-balanced mix of growth-oriented and
stabilizing assets.

### Asset Buckets

Below are the primary asset buckets in my portfolio:

1. Equity
2. Hybrid
3. Fixed Income
4. Commodity: Gold & Silver

Yes, the framework considers Hybrid funds as a separate asset class. To keep things simple, Hybrid is treated as its own
bucket rather than splitting it into equity and debt components during rebalancing.

**Note**: Calculated Portfolio Look-through: Total Effective Equity = ~75%." This ensures you don't underestimate your
volatility.

### Strategic Target Allocation (Base)

| Asset Class   | Target Allocation |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Equity        | 60%               |
| Hybrid        | 20%               |
| Fixed Income  | 10%               |
| Gold & Silver | 10%               |

### Equity Allocation (Within 60%)

| Market cap    | % of Equity | % of Portfolio |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| Large Cap     | 50%         | 30%            |
| Mid Cap       | 20%         | 12%            |
| Small Cap     | 10%         | 6%             |
| Flexi / Value | 15%         | 9%             |
| International | 5%          | 3%             |

### Investment Strategies by Market Cap

### Strategic Allocation for SIP

SIP contributions are allocated according to the strategic target asset allocation, but except for Mid Cap and Small Cap
(which are only lumpsum), all other asset classes receive SIP contributions. This is because of their nature of being
more volatile and are better suited for opportunistic lumpsum investments rather than regular SIPs.

Let's assume a monthly SIP of Rupees (₹) 10,000.

| Asset Class                  | Target Allocation | Rupees (₹) |
|------------------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Equity - Core Large Cap Fund | 40%               | ₹4,000     |
| Equity - Flexi / Value Fund  | 15%               | ₹1,500     |
| Equity - International Fund  | 5%                | ₹500       |
| Hybrid                       | 20%               | ₹2,000     |
| Fixed Income                 | 10%               | ₹1,000     |
| Gold & Silver                | 10%               | ₹1,000     |

## Tactical Rebalancing Strategy

Tactical rebalancing provides **controlled flexibility** within the boundaries of the strategic asset allocation.
It allows for **opportunistic adjustments** based on market conditions while maintaining overall portfolio discipline.

All tactical actions operate within predefined limits and **must never compromise the integrity of the core portfolio**.

### Strategic Allocation Bands

Based on my risk tolerance and investment horizon, I have defined the following strategic allocation bands for each
asset class. These bands act as both risk controls and rebalancing triggers.

| Asset Class         | Target Allocation | Lower Band | Upper Band |
|---------------------|-------------------|------------|------------|
| Equity (±7%)        | 60%               | 53%        | 67%        |
| Large Cap (±5%)     | 30%               | 25%        | 35%        |
| Mid Cap (±4%)       | 12%               | 8%         | 16%        |
| Small Cap (±3%)     | 6%                | 3%         | 9%         |
| Flexi / Value (±4%) | 9%                | 5%         | 13%        |
| International (±2%) | 3%                | 1%         | 5%         |
| Hybrid (±5%)        | 20%               | 15%        | 25%        |
| Fixed Income (±5%)  | 10%               | 5%         | 15%        |
| Gold & Silver (±5%) | 10%               | 5%         | 15%        |

### Investment Execution Rules

* Tactical rebalancing is **incremental**, not all-in or all-out
* No asset class is fully exited or aggressively overweighted
* Tactical moves only in 5% chunks
* New inflows are used first before selling existing holdings
* Gains from tactical adjustments are absorbed back into the core portfolio

### Rebalancing Triggers

Rebalancing is triggered by either time-based or threshold-based criteria, whichever occurs first.

- Time-based: Portfolio review and rebalance once per year
- Threshold-based: When an asset class breaches its defined allocation band:
    - Equity: ±7%
    - Large cap: ±5%
    - Mid cap: ±4%
    - Small cap: ±3%
    - Flexi / Value: ±4%
    - International Equity: ±2%
    - Hybrid: ±5%
    - Fixed Income: ±5%
    - Gold & Silver: ±5%

### What Tactical Rebalancing Is Not

- Not a short-term trading strategy
- Not a prediction of market tops or bottoms
- Not a frequent activity
- Not driven by news, opinions, or market narratives

## Risk Management

Risk management is a core pillar of **My Systematic Investment Framework**. The objective is not to eliminate risk, but
to **control downside, preserve capital, and ensure long-term sustainability** of the portfolio. All risk is managed
through **structure, allocation, and discipline**, not through prediction or frequent trading.

### Key Risk Management Principles

- Risk is assessed at the portfolio level, not based on short-term market movements
- No single asset class, fund category, or strategy is allowed to dominate the portfolio
- Strategic asset allocation is the primary and first line of risk control
- Allocation limits for each asset class are clearly defined and strictly respected
- Rebalancing is used to reduce risk, not to chase returns or time the market

### Exposure and Concentration Controls

- Strict allocation caps are applied to: Small-cap equity, Mid-cap equity, Tactical strategies
- Experimental or tactical strategies are limited to a maximum of 5% of the total portfolio
- The integrity of the core portfolio is never compromised for short-term opportunities
- Overlapping funds and redundant exposures are actively avoided

### Diversification and Stability

- Diversification is maintained across:
    - Asset classes
    - Market capitalizations
    - Investment styles
    - Geographies
- Hybrid and fixed income allocations act as stabilizers during periods of equity market volatility
- Over-concentration in any single asset, sector, or theme is avoided

### Liquidity and Safety Buffer

- A dedicated **liquidity buffer / emergency fund** is maintained **outside** the investment portfolio
- Fixed income allocation provides: Capital stability, Liquidity for rebalancing during market corrections

### Review and Oversight

- Changes are made deliberately and never during periods of market stress
- Portfolio risk exposure is reviewed at least **annually**
- High-risk investments that do not align with risk tolerance are avoided
- Reviews focus on:
    - Allocation drift
    - Concentration risk
    - Alignment with risk tolerance and long-term objectives

## Review & Monitoring

Regular review and monitoring are essential components of My Systematic Investment Framework. They ensure that the
portfolio remains aligned with strategic objectives, adheres to defined rules, and responds appropriately to changing
market conditions without succumbing to emotional decision-making.

### Moving Average Indicator (50 / 100 / 200 DMA)

Moving averages are used only as trend and risk indicators, not as precise entry or exit signals.

General Rules (Applicable to All Assets):

- 200 DMA → Primary trend & risk filter
- 100 DMA → Intermediate trend confirmation
- 50 DMA → Short-term momentum (observational only)

**Trend Zones and Actions**:

| Market Condition | Technical Signal           | Framework Action                          |
|------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Bullish          | Price > 100 & 200 DMA      | Status Quo: Continue SIPs; No Lumpsums    |
| Correction       | Price between 100-200 DMA  | Caution: SIPs only; Prep Lumpsum tranches |
| Bearish          | Price < 200 DMA            | Opportunity: Deploy Lumpsum Tranche 1     |
| Capitulation     | Price 15-20% below 200 DMA | Aggressive: Deploy Lumpsum Tranche 2      |

**Tactical Action Matrix**:

| Asset Class              | Role                       | Above 200 DMA | Between 100–200 DMA     | Below 200 DMA                                  | Extreme / Overheated     |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Equity (Overall)**     | Core growth                | Continue SIPs | SIP only, pause lumpsum | Gradual increase via tranches                  | Trim via rebalance       |
| **Large Cap**            | Stability & compounding    | SIP only      | SIP only                | Lumpsum in stages                              | Preferred over mid/small |
| **Mid Cap**              | Growth                     | SIP only      | Pause lumpsum           | Selective staged lumpsum                       | Avoid aggressive adds    |
| **Small Cap**            | Return enhancer            | SIP only      | SIP only                | SIP continues; lumpsum only in deep correction | Trim via rebalance       |
| **Flexi / Value**        | Style diversification      | SIP only      | Monitor                 | Add selectively                                | Reduce if overweight     |
| **International Equity** | Geographic diversification | SIP only      | Pause lumpsum           | Selective accumulation                         | Reduce excess exposure   |
| **Hybrid**               | Volatility control         | SIP only      | SIP only                | No tactical increase                           | Maintain target          |
| **Fixed Income**         | Stability & liquidity      | Maintain      | Maintain                | Source of capital                              | Rebuild post-rebalance   |
| **Gold & Silver**        | Hedge                      | SIP only      | SIP only                | Accumulate gradually                           | Trim excess              |

### Frequency

Portfolio reviews are conducted on a fixed schedule. Reviews are observational and rule-based, not reactive.
No changes are made outside this schedule unless triggered by predefined rules.

- Monthly: Quick Check (observe)
- Quarterly: Deeper Review (prepare)
- Annual: rebalance decision (execute if required)

### Monthly Review Checklist (10–15 minutes)

**Purpose**: Monitor health, ensure discipline, avoid drift

- SIPs executed successfully (no missed or paused SIPs)
- Portfolio allocation broadly within strategic bands
- No asset class materially breached risk limits
- Tactical exposure within the 5% cap
- Major market movements acknowledged but not acted upon
- Review completed without any portfolio changes

### Quarterly Review Checklist (30–45 minutes)

**Purpose**: Purpose: Risk control, alignment, and preparation

- Allocation bands respected for all asset classes
    - Asset allocation drift reviewed at bucket level
    - Risk concentration (mid/small cap, active funds) within limits
- Overlapping funds and redundant exposures reviewed
- Tactical positions reviewed for relevance and size
- Fixed income and liquidity adequacy confirmed
- Gold & hybrid allocations aligned with stabilizing role

- Monitor moving average indicators for tactical signals
    - Check 15-20% corrections in Nifty index for lumpsum opportunities
    - Nifty MidCap 150 index vs 200 DMA
        - If Price > 200 DMA AND 100 DMA > 200 DMA → consider tactical entry
        - If Price < 200 DMA for 3 weeks → consider tactical exit/rebalance
    - Nifty SmallCap 250 index vs 200 DMA
        - If Price > 200 DMA AND 150 DMA > 200 DMA → consider tactical entry
        - If Price < 200 DMA for 3 weeks → consider tactical exit/rebalance

### Annual Review Checklist (60–90 minutes)

**Purpose**: Structural review and disciplined rebalancing

- Full portfolio allocation vs strategic targets reviewed
- Threshold breaches confirmed and documented
- Rebalancing executed (if required) at bucket level
- New inflows used preferentially for rebalancing
- Tactical adjustments unwound or normalized
- Risk tolerance and time horizon revalidated
- Emergency fund adequacy reconfirmed
- Fund count ≤ 10 and one fund per category maintained
- Performance reviewed relative to process, not benchmarks

## Rules

This section defines the **non-negotiable rules** governing portfolio construction, investment execution, and behavior.
These rules exist to protect discipline, reduce emotional errors, and ensure long-term consistency across market cycles.

### Core Portfolio Rules

* Strategic allocation is adjusted only during life events or structural changes — not market noise.
* Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) run automatically:
    * SIPs are never paused or stopped, regardless of market conditions.
* Category-specific execution rules:
    * Mid-Cap Equity: Lumpsum investments in index funds only; no SIPs
    * Small-Cap Equity: Lumpsum investments in actively managed funds only; no SIPs

### What to Do

- Adhere strictly to defined strategic allocation bands
- Rebalance only at the asset-bucket level, not at individual fund level
- Use new inflows first for rebalancing before selling existing holdings
- Maintain the same strategic allocation across bull, bear, and sideways markets
- Market movements alone do not justify altering the strategic mix
- Treat rebalancing as a risk-management tool, not a return-enhancement or market-timing strategy
- Follow the written framework during periods of uncertainty
- Review fund overlap and exposure before adding any new fund

### What Not to Do

* Do not fully exit equity or any asset class
* Do not rebalance by splitting hybrid funds into equity and debt components
* Do not hold more than one fund per fund category
* Do not add any fund without a clearly defined role in the portfolio
* Do not react to daily or weekly market movements
* Do not sell core portfolio holdings to fund tactical or experimental strategies
* Do not chase past performance or recent winners
* Do not switch funds frequently
* Do not attempt to time market tops or bottoms
* Do not make emotional decisions based on short-term volatility
* Do not hold more than 10 funds in the entire portfolio
* Do not compare portfolio performance frequently with others
* Do not redesign the portfolio every year
* Do not change rules during periods of market stress or crisis
* Do not invest in individual stocks
* Do not invest in speculative or high-risk assets outside defined risk tolerance
* Do not let recent market performance dictate portfolio decisions

## Emergency Protocol: What to do in market crash ?

In the event of a significant market crash (e.g., a drop of 20% or more in major indices), it is crucial to follow a
predefined emergency protocol to maintain discipline and avoid emotional decision-making.

The following steps outline the actions to take during such market downturns:

- **Stay Calm and Assess**
    - Do not panic sell. Market crashes are normal in long-term investing.
    - Check strategic allocation bands for each asset class: identify breaches.
- **Follow the Rulebook**
    - Review Core Principles and Rules.
    - Rebalance only if allocation bands are breached.
    - Maintain SIPs in all eligible assets; never pause.
    - Do not exit any asset class completely.

## Final Thoughts

Investing is a journey, not a sprint. Building wealth consistently over time requires **discipline, patience, and
adherence to a well-defined framework**. The first million is often the hardest, not because of market
complexity, but because of the mental discipline required to stay the course.

Remember:

> Time in the market, discipline, and consistency matter far more than timing the market or chasing short-term returns.

Finally, investing is not just about numbers — it is about **behaving intelligently and calmly** when markets are
uncertain. The framework ensures I act with confidence, even in the most challenging times.

> This rulebook exists to protect me from myself.

**Mutual Fund investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.**
