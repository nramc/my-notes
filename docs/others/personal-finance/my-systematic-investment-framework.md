# My Systematic Investment Framework

> Rules-Based Asset Allocation, Risk Management & Rebalancing

## Overview

This document defines **My Systematic Investment Framework**, a structured and rule-based approach to managing my
personal investments in the share market(Indian Equity).

The primary objective of this framework is to support long-term wealth creation while minimizing the impact of emotional
decision-making, short-term market noise, and behavioral biases. All investment decisions are made within a clearly
documented set of principles and rules, ensuring consistency across different market cycles.

This framework serves as a personal investment constitution — a reference system that helps maintain discipline during
both favorable and adverse market conditions. It emphasizes process over prediction, rules over reactions, and
consistency over short-term outcomes.

### Motivation

The motivation behind creating this framework is:

- To help my family and me achieve long-term financial goals through disciplined investing
- To document a clear, rules-based investment approach that can be followed consistently
- To enable family members to understand and adhere to a common investment philosophy
- To make repeatable and well-reasoned investment decisions
- To reduce emotional buying, selling, and market timing errors
- To avoid overtrading, performance chasing, and panic-driven actions
- To balance long-term wealth creation with limited, rule-based tactical flexibility
- To manage risk systematically while pursuing sustainable growth

**Primary Objectives** of This Framework:

* **Primary goal**: Long-term wealth creation with controlled drawdowns
* **Secondary goal**: Avoid emotional decisions during market extremes

### What This Framework Covers

This framework provides guidance on:

- Core investment principles and behavioral rules
- Strategic and tactical asset allocation decisions
- Investment rules across different market capitalization segments
- Risk management and position sizing guidelines
- Portfolio monitoring and review indicators
- Rebalancing methodology and decision triggers
- A centralized reference for all investment-related decisions

### What This Framework Does Not Cover

This framework intentionally does **not** address:

- Specific investment products, securities, or stock selection
- Detailed financial planning, tax planning, or goal quantification
- Day-to-day trading or short-term speculative strategies
- Market predictions or return guarantees
- Get-rich-quick or high-risk trading approaches
- A replacement for professional financial advice

## Core Principles

The following principles form the foundation of My Systematic Investment Framework.
These principles are designed to remain valid across market cycles and are not changed based on recent performance or
market sentiment.

1. **Allocation First**: Asset allocation matters more than fund selection.
2. **Core & Satellite**: Index funds form the core; active funds are satellites.
3. **Manage Risk**: Diversify and rebalance; risk is controlled, not chased.
4. **Consistency Wins**: No shortcuts—long-term investing beats timing.
5. **Ignore Noise**: Stick to the plan; avoid decisions based on news or social media.
6. **Investor, Not Trader**: Focus on long-term growth, not short-term trades.
7. **Think Long-Term**: Core portfolio is built for 10+ years.
8. **Review, Don’t Overreact**: Check regularly but change sparingly.
9. **Discipline Over Timing**: Consistent investing beats market timing. Follow rules, not forecasts.
10. **Keep It Simple**: Simple, clear strategies outperform complex ones.

> When faced with uncertainty, I follow the framework—not emotions, opinions, or predictions.

## Strategic Asset Allocation

Strategic Asset Allocation defines the **default structure of my portfolio**.
It represents how my investments are allocated under normal market conditions and serves as the anchor for all
investment and rebalancing decisions.
This allocation is designed to balance **long-term growth** with **risk control and stability**.

The framework follows a **60–20–10–10 structure**, which provides a well-balanced mix of growth-oriented and stabilizing
assets.

### Asset Buckets

Below are the primary asset buckets in my portfolio:

* Equity
* Hybrid
* Fixed Income
* Commodity: Gold & Silver

Yes, the framework considers Hybrid funds as a separate asset class. To keep things simple, Hybrid is treated as its own
bucket rather than splitting it into equity and debt components during rebalancing.

### Strategic Target Allocation (Base)

| Asset Class   | Target Allocation |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Equity        | 60%               |
| Hybrid        | 20%               |
| Fixed Income  | 10%               |
| Gold & Silver | 10%               |

### Equity Allocation (Within 60%)

| Market cap    | % of Equity | % of Portfolio |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| Large Cap     | 50%         | 30%            |
| Mid Cap       | 20%         | 12%            |
| Small Cap     | 10%         | 6%             |
| Flexi / Value | 10%         | 6%             |
| International | 10%         | 6%             |

### Investment Strategies by Market Cap

| Debt          | Capital preservation + income             | Debt funds, bonds                 | SIP in all conditions                                                                                                   | No tactical exit, only rebalance                          |

### International Equity Strategy

### Debt Strategy

### Gold & Silver Strategy

## Risk Management

- Diversification across asset classes
- Regular rebalancing to maintain target allocations
- Avoid over-concentration in any single asset or sector
- Maintain an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses
- Use stop-loss orders judiciously to limit downside risk
- Review portfolio risk profile annually
- Avoid high-risk investments that do not align with risk tolerance
- Liquidity buffer (emergency fund)

## Tactical Rebalancing Strategy

### Investment Execution Rules

* Tactical moves only in 5–10% chunks
* Use new inflows first before selling existing assets

### Rebalancing Triggers

You rebalance only at bucket level:

* Once a year
* Or ±5–7% drift
  You do not:
* Split hybrid into equity/debt
* Rebalance gold against equity monthly
* Worry about internal fund changes

Tactical rules I recommend

* Rebalance once per year OR when any asset drifts ±7–10%
* During equity euphoria → shift new money to Hybrid / Debt
* During deep corrections → deploy Hybrid → Equity
  Tactical allocation should be rule-based, not emotional.


- Time-based: Once per year
- Threshold-based:
    - Equity: ±7%
    - Large cap: ±5%
    - Mid cap: ±4%
    - Small cap: ±3%
    - Hybrid: ±5%
    - International Equity: ±2%
    - Debt: ±5%
    - Gold: ±5%

## Rules

* Strategic allocation is adjusted only during life events or structural changes — not market noise.
* MidCap - lumpsum on index fund - no sip
* Small Cap - lumpsum on actively managed fund - no sip
* SIP runs automatically, Never stopped, Never paused

### What to Do

* Stick to strategic allocation bands
* Rebalance only at bucket level
* Use new inflows first for rebalancing
* Strategic allocation remains stable across market cycles
* Changes are made only due to life events or long-term structural reasons
* Market movements alone do not justify altering the strategic mix
* Rebalancing is a risk-management tool, not a market-timing mechanism

### What Not to Do

* Do not exit equity completely
* Do not exit any asset class completely
* Do not split Hybrid into equity/debt for rebalancing, keep it as a single bucket
* Do not react daily, weekly
* Never sell Core funds to fund Sandbox
* Avoid chasing past performance
* Avoid frequent switching between funds
* Avoid market timing attempts, try to catch exact market bottoms
* Avoid emotional decisions based on short-term market movements
* Do not have more than 10 funds in the portfolio
* Do not compare with others constantly
* Do not redesign portfolio every year
* Do not change rules mid-crisis
* Do not add new funds without a clear role

## Review & Monitoring

### Core Indicators

- Index vs 200 DMA
- PE / valuation band (broad, not precise)
- Advance–Decline ratio (monthly)
- Asset allocation drift

### Frequency

- Monthly: quick check
- Quarterly: deeper review
- Annual: rebalance decision

### Review Checklist (Once a Year)

✔ Asset allocation within bands
✔ Equity risk aligned with comfort level
✔ Hybrid doing its stabilizing job
✔ Gold allocation intact
✔ Rules followed — not emotions

## Decision-Making Checklist

Before any buy/sell, ask:

- Is this allowed by my system?
- Is this strategic or tactical?
- What rule triggers this action?
- Will this improve or harm discipline?
- Would I repeat this decision again?

If any answer is **unclear → don’t act**.

## Documentation & Logging

## Emergency Protocol

### What to do in market crash ?
