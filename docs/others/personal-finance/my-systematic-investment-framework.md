# My Systematic Investment Framework

> Rules-Based Asset Allocation, Risk Management & Rebalancing

## Overview

This document defines **My Systematic Investment Framework**, a structured and rule-based approach to managing my
personal investments in the share market(Indian Equity).

The primary objective of this framework is to support long-term wealth creation while minimizing the impact of emotional
decision-making, short-term market noise, and behavioral biases. All investment decisions are made within a clearly
documented set of principles and rules, ensuring consistency across different market cycles.

This framework serves as a personal investment constitution — a reference system that helps maintain discipline during
both favorable and adverse market conditions. It emphasizes process over prediction, rules over reactions, and
consistency over short-term outcomes.

### Motivation

The motivation behind creating this framework is:

- To help my family and me achieve long-term financial goals through disciplined investing
- To document a clear, rules-based investment approach that can be followed consistently
- To enable family members to understand and adhere to a common investment philosophy
- To make repeatable and well-reasoned investment decisions
- To reduce emotional buying, selling, and market timing errors
- To avoid overtrading, performance chasing, and panic-driven actions
- To balance long-term wealth creation with limited, rule-based tactical flexibility
- To manage risk systematically while pursuing sustainable growth

### What This Framework Covers

This framework provides guidance on:

- Core investment principles and behavioral rules
- Strategic and tactical asset allocation decisions
- Investment rules across different market capitalization segments
- Risk management and position sizing guidelines
- Portfolio monitoring and review indicators
- Rebalancing methodology and decision triggers
- A centralized reference for all investment-related decisions

### What This Framework Does Not Cover

This framework intentionally does **not** address:

- Specific investment products, securities, or stock selection
- Detailed financial planning, tax planning, or goal quantification
- Day-to-day trading or short-term speculative strategies
- Market predictions or return guarantees
- Get-rich-quick or high-risk trading approaches
- A replacement for professional financial advice

## Core Principles

The following principles form the foundation of My Systematic Investment Framework.
These principles are designed to remain valid across market cycles and are not changed based on recent performance or
market sentiment.

1. **Allocation First**: Asset allocation matters more than fund selection.
2. **Core & Satellite**: Index funds form the core; active funds are satellites.
3. **Manage Risk**: Diversify and rebalance; risk is controlled, not chased.
4. **Consistency Wins**: No shortcuts—long-term investing beats timing.
5. **Ignore Noise**: Stick to the plan; avoid decisions based on news or social media.
6. **Investor, Not Trader**: Focus on long-term growth, not short-term trades.
7. **Think Long-Term**: Core portfolio is built for 10+ years.
8. **Review, Don’t Overreact**: Check regularly but change sparingly.
9. **Discipline Over Timing**: Consistent investing beats market timing. Follow rules, not forecasts.
10. **Keep It Simple**: Simple, clear strategies outperform complex ones.

> When faced with uncertainty, I follow the framework—not emotions, opinions, or predictions.

## Strategic Asset Allocation

### Large Cap Strategy

- Role: Stability + compounding
- Preferred: Index funds
- Investment style:
    - SIP in all conditions
    - Lumpsum only during:
        - 10–20% index correction
        - Below long-term moving average
- Exit rule: No tactical exit, only rebalance

### Mid Cap Strategy

- Role: Growth with controlled risk
- Preferred: Index funds
- Investment style:
    - Lumpsum only when:
        - Index below 200 DMA
        - Valuation below long-term average

### Small Cap Strategy

- Role: Return enhancer (not wealth protector)
- Preferred: Active funds with strong track record
- Investment style:
    - Lumpsum only when:
        - Index below 200 DMA
        - Valuation below long-term average
- Exit = rebalance, not panic sell

### Hybrid Strategy

### International Equity Strategy

### Debt Strategy

### Gold & Silver Strategy

## Rules

👉 Rule: Strategic allocation is adjusted only during life events or structural changes — not market noise.

### What to Do

### What Not to Do

## Risk Management

- Diversification across asset classes
- Regular rebalancing to maintain target allocations
- Avoid over-concentration in any single asset or sector
- Maintain an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses
- Use stop-loss orders judiciously to limit downside risk
- Review portfolio risk profile annually
- Avoid high-risk investments that do not align with risk tolerance
- Liquidity buffer (emergency fund)

## Tactical Rebalancing Strategy

### Rebalancing Triggers

- Time-based: Once per year
- Threshold-based:
    - Equity: ±7%
    - Large cap: ±5%
    - Mid cap: ±4%
    - Small cap: ±3%
    - Hybrid: ±5%
    - International Equity: ±2%
    - Debt: ±5%
    - Gold: ±5%

## Review & Monitoring

### Core Indicators

- Index vs 200 DMA
- PE / valuation band (broad, not precise)
- Advance–Decline ratio (monthly)
- Asset allocation drift

## Frequency

- Monthly: quick check
- Quarterly: deeper review
- Annual: rebalance decision

## Decision-Making Checklist

Before any buy/sell, ask:

- Is this allowed by my system?
- Is this strategic or tactical?
- What rule triggers this action?
- Will this improve or harm discipline?
- Would I repeat this decision again?

If any answer is **unclear → don’t act**.
