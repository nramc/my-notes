# My Systematic Investment Framework

> Rules-Based Asset Allocation, Risk Management & Rebalancing

## Overview

This document defines **My Systematic Investment Framework**, a structured and rule-based approach to managing my
personal investments in the share market(Indian Equity).

The primary objective of this framework is to support long-term wealth creation while minimizing the impact of emotional
decision-making, short-term market noise, and behavioral biases. All investment decisions are made within a clearly
documented set of principles and rules, ensuring consistency across different market cycles.

This framework serves as a personal investment constitution — a reference system that helps maintain discipline during
both favorable and adverse market conditions. It emphasizes process over prediction, rules over reactions, and
consistency over short-term outcomes.

### Motivation

The motivation behind creating this framework is:

- To help my family and me achieve long-term financial goals through disciplined investing
- To document a clear, rules-based investment approach that can be followed consistently
- To enable family members to understand and adhere to a common investment philosophy
- To make repeatable and well-reasoned investment decisions
- To reduce emotional buying, selling, and market timing errors
- To avoid overtrading, performance chasing, and panic-driven actions
- To balance long-term wealth creation with limited, rule-based tactical flexibility
- To manage risk systematically while pursuing sustainable growth

**Primary Objectives** of This Framework:

* **Primary goal**: Long-term wealth creation with controlled drawdowns
* **Secondary goal**: Avoid emotional decisions during market extremes
* **Tertiary goal**: Transfer knowledge about financial literacy to family members and next generations

### What This Framework Covers

This framework provides guidance on:

- Core investment principles and behavioral rules
- Strategic and tactical asset allocation decisions
- Investment rules across different market capitalization segments
- Risk management and position sizing guidelines
- Portfolio monitoring and review indicators
- Rebalancing methodology and decision triggers
- A centralized reference for all investment-related decisions

### What This Framework Does Not Cover

This framework intentionally does **not** address:

- Specific investment products, securities, or stock selection
- Detailed financial planning, tax planning, or goal quantification
- Day-to-day trading or short-term speculative strategies
- Market predictions or return guarantees
- Get-rich-quick or high-risk trading approaches
- A replacement for professional financial advice

## Core Principles

The following principles form the foundation of My Systematic Investment Framework.
These principles are designed to remain valid across market cycles and are not changed based on recent performance or
market sentiment.

1. **Allocation First**: Asset allocation matters more than fund selection.
2. **Core & Satellite**: Large cap Index funds form the core; all other funds are satellites.
3. **Manage Risk**: Diversify and rebalance; risk is controlled, not chased.
4. **Consistency Wins**: No shortcuts—long-term investing beats timing.
5. **Ignore Noise**: Stick to the plan; avoid decisions based on news or social media.
6. **Investor, Not Trader**: Focus on long-term growth, not short-term trades.
7. **Think Long-Term**: Core portfolio is built for 10+ years. Believe in compounding over time.
8. **Review, Don’t Overreact**: Check regularly but change sparingly.
9. **Discipline Over Timing**: Consistent investing beats market timing. Follow rules, not forecasts.
10. **Keep It Simple**: Simple, clear strategies outperform complex ones.
11. **Mutual Funds Over Stocks**: Use mutual funds rather than picking individual stocks. IMO, stock picking is a
    zero-sum game and not worth the effort for retail investors.
12. **Believe in Compounding**: Compounding is the eighth wonder of the world. Start early, stay invested, and let time
    work its magic.

## Strategic Asset Allocation

Strategic Asset Allocation defines the **default structure of my portfolio**.
It represents how my investments are allocated under normal market conditions and serves as the anchor for all
investment and rebalancing decisions.
This allocation is designed to balance **long-term growth** with **risk control and stability**.

The framework follows a **60–20–10–10 structure**, which provides a well-balanced mix of growth-oriented and stabilizing
assets.

### Asset Buckets

Below are the primary asset buckets in my portfolio:

1. Equity
2. Hybrid
3. Fixed Income
4. Commodity: Gold & Silver

Yes, the framework considers Hybrid funds as a separate asset class. To keep things simple, Hybrid is treated as its own
bucket rather than splitting it into equity and debt components during rebalancing.

### Strategic Target Allocation (Base)

| Asset Class   | Target Allocation |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Equity        | 60%               |
| Hybrid        | 20%               |
| Fixed Income  | 10%               |
| Gold & Silver | 10%               |

### Equity Allocation (Within 60%)

| Market cap    | % of Equity | % of Portfolio |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| Large Cap     | 50%         | 30%            |
| Mid Cap       | 20%         | 12%            |
| Small Cap     | 10%         | 6%             |
| Flexi / Value | 15%         | 9%             |
| International | 5%          | 3%             |

### Investment Strategies by Market Cap

### Strategic Allocation for SIP

SIP contributions are allocated according to the strategic target asset allocation, but except for Mid Cap and Small Cap
(which are only lumpsum), all other asset classes receive SIP contributions. This is because of their nature of being
more volatile and are better suited for opportunistic lumpsum investments rather than regular SIPs.

Let's assume a monthly SIP of Rupees(₹) 10,000.

| Asset Class                  | Target Allocation | Rupees(₹) |
|------------------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Equity - Core Large Cap Fund | 40%               | ₹4,000    |
| Equity - Flexi / Value Fund  | 15%               | ₹1,500    |
| Equity - International Fund  | 5%                | ₹500      |
| Hybrid                       | 20%               | ₹2,000    |
| Fixed Income                 | 10%               | ₹1,000    |
| Gold & Silver                | 10%               | ₹1,000    |

## todo: Tactical Rebalancing Strategy

## Risk Management

Risk management is a core pillar of **My Systematic Investment Framework**. The objective is not to eliminate risk, but
to **control downside, preserve capital, and ensure long-term sustainability** of the portfolio. All risk is managed
through **structure, allocation, and discipline**, not through prediction or frequent trading.

### Key Risk Management Principles

- Risk is assessed at the portfolio level, not based on short-term market movements
- No single asset class, fund category, or strategy is allowed to dominate the portfolio
- Strategic asset allocation is the primary and first line of risk control
- Allocation limits for each asset class are clearly defined and strictly respected
- Rebalancing is used to reduce risk, not to chase returns or time the market

### Exposure and Concentration Controls

- Strict allocation caps are applied to: Small-cap equity, Mid-cap equity, Tactical strategies
- Experimental or tactical strategies are limited to a maximum of 5% of the total portfolio
- The integrity of the core portfolio is never compromised for short-term opportunities
- Overlapping funds and redundant exposures are actively avoided

### Diversification and Stability

- Diversification is maintained across:
    - Asset classes
    - Market capitalizations
    - Investment styles
    - Geographies
- Hybrid and fixed income allocations act as stabilizers during periods of equity market volatility
- Over-concentration in any single asset, sector, or theme is avoided

### Liquidity and Safety Buffer

- A dedicated **liquidity buffer / emergency fund** is maintained **outside** the investment portfolio
- Fixed income allocation provides: Capital stability, Liquidity for rebalancing during market corrections

### Review and Oversight

- Changes are made deliberately and never during periods of market stress
- Portfolio risk exposure is reviewed at least **annually**
- High-risk investments that do not align with risk tolerance are avoided
- Reviews focus on:
    - Allocation drift
    - Concentration risk
    - Alignment with risk tolerance and long-term objectives

## Tactical Rebalancing Strategy

### Strategic Allocation Bands

Based on my risk tolerance and investment horizon, I have defined the following strategic allocation bands for each
asset class.

| Asset Class         | Target Allocation | Lower Band | Upper Band |
|---------------------|-------------------|------------|------------|
| Equity (±7%)        | 60%               | 53%        | 67%        |
| Large Cap (±5%)     | 30%               | 25%        | 35%        |
| Mid Cap (±4%)       | 12%               | 8%         | 16%        |
| Small Cap (±3%)     | 6%                | 3%         | 9%         |
| Flexi / Value (±4%) | 9%                | 5%         | 13%        |
| International (±2%) | 3%                | 1%         | 5%         |
| Hybrid (±5%)        | 20%               | 15%        | 25%        |
| Fixed Income (±5%)  | 10%               | 5%         | 15%        |
| Gold & Silver (±5%) | 10%               | 5%         | 15%        |

### Investment Execution Rules

* Tactical moves only in 5–10% chunks
* Use new inflows first before selling existing assets

### Rebalancing Triggers

You rebalance only at bucket level:

* Once a year
* Or ±5–7% drift
  You do not:
* Split hybrid into equity/debt
* Rebalance gold against equity monthly
* Worry about internal fund changes

Tactical rules I recommend

* Rebalance once per year OR when any asset drifts ±7–10%
* During equity euphoria → shift new money to Hybrid / Debt
* During deep corrections → deploy Hybrid → Equity
  Tactical allocation should be rule-based, not emotional.


- Time-based: Once per year
- Threshold-based:

    - Large cap: ±5%
    - Mid cap: ±4%
    - Small cap: ±3%
    - Flexi / Value: ±4%
    - International Equity: ±2%

## Rules

* Strategic allocation is adjusted only during life events or structural changes — not market noise.
* MidCap - lumpsum on index fund - no sip
* Small Cap - lumpsum on actively managed fund - no sip
* SIP runs automatically, Never stopped, Never paused

### What to Do

* Stick to strategic allocation bands
* Rebalance only at bucket level
* Use new inflows first for rebalancing
* Strategic allocation remains stable across market cycles
* Changes are made only due to life events or long-term structural reasons
* Market movements alone do not justify altering the strategic mix
* Rebalancing is a risk-management tool, not a market-timing mechanism
* When faced with uncertainty, I follow the framework—not emotions, opinions, or predictions.
* Always check overlap between funds before adding new ones

### What Not to Do

* Do not exit equity completely
* Do not exit any asset class completely
* Do not split Hybrid into equity/debt for rebalancing, keep it as a single bucket
* Do not add more than one fund per fund category
* Do not add any new fund without a clear role
* Do not react daily, weekly
* Never sell Core funds to fund Sandbox
* Avoid chasing past performance
* Avoid frequent switching between funds
* Avoid market timing attempts, try to catch exact market bottoms
* Avoid emotional decisions based on short-term market movements
* Do not have more than 10 funds in the portfolio
* Do not compare with others constantly
* Do not redesign portfolio every year
* Do not change rules mid-crisis
* Do not add new funds without a clear role
* Do not invest in individual stocks, since stock picking is a zero-sum game for retail investors
* Do not invest in high-risk, speculative assets that do not align with risk tolerance
* Do not let recent market performance dictate investment decisions

## Review & Monitoring

### Core Indicators

- Index vs 200 DMA
- PE / valuation band (broad, not precise)
- Advance–Decline ratio (monthly)
- Asset allocation drift

### Frequency

- Monthly: quick check
- Quarterly: deeper review
- Annual: rebalance decision

### Review Checklist (Monthly)

- TODO: check 15-20% corrections in Nifty 50 index
- Review asset allocation drift
- Nifty MidCap 150 index vs 200 DMA
    - If Price > 200 DMA AND 100 DMA > 200 DMA → consider tactical entry
    - If Price < 200 DMA for 3 weeks → consider tactical exit/rebalance
- Nifty SmallCap 250 index vs 200 DMA
    - If Price > 200 DMA AND 150 DMA > 200 DMA → consider tactical entry
    - If Price < 200 DMA for 3 weeks → consider tactical exit/rebalance

### Review Checklist (Once a Year)

✔ Asset allocation within bands
✔ Equity risk aligned with comfort level
✔ Hybrid doing its stabilizing job
✔ Gold allocation intact
✔ Rules followed — not emotions

## Decision-Making Checklist

Before any buy/sell, ask:

- Is this allowed by my system?
- Is this strategic or tactical?
- What rule triggers this action?
- Will this improve or harm discipline?
- Would I repeat this decision again?

If any answer is **unclear → don’t act**.

## Documentation & Logging

## Emergency Protocol

### What to do in market crash ?

- Stay calm, avoid panic selling
- Review portfolio against rules
- Identify buying opportunities based on framework
- Consider gradual buying (staggered lumpsum) to average down
- Avoid making hasty decisions based on fear
- Consult with a financial advisor if unsure
- Maintain liquidity to take advantage of opportunities
- Stick to long-term investment plan
- Review emergency fund status
- Document actions taken and rationale
- Learn from the experience for future preparedness
- Focus on long-term goals and strategy

## Conclusion

## Final Thoughts

First one million is hardest.
