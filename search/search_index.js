OpenRewrite   automates repetitive tasks like upgrading deprecated APIs, adjusting library versions, and fixing outdated patterns,   saving developers hours of manual work.</li> <li>Ensure Code Consistency:   In large teams or organizations, different developers may write code in slightly different   styles or patterns. OpenRewrite ensures that changes are applied consistently across the entire codebase, maintaining   uniformity in coding standards.</li> <li>Maintainable and Modern Code:   As programming languages evolve and libraries are updated, developers need to keep   their codebases modern. OpenRewrite simplifies this process by automatically updating APIs, language features, and   libraries without having to rewrite everything manually, allowing developers to adopt the latest best practices   effortlessly.</li> <li>Faster Technical Debt Reduction:   Over time, codebases accumulate technical debt, such as outdated code, inefficient patterns, or unused imports.   OpenRewrite helps developers tackle this debt by automating refactoring tasks, ensuring the codebase stays clean,   efficient, and manageable without requiring dedicated time for manual cleanup.</li> <li>Improve Security Automatically:   Security vulnerabilities in dependencies are a major concern for developers. OpenRewrite can automate updates to   vulnerable libraries and ensure the project is running on secure versions. This keeps the code secure without   developers needing to manually track and update dependencies.</li> <li>Easier Legacy Code Maintenance:   Legacy codebases are often difficult to maintain due to outdated technologies, libraries, or patterns. Developers can   use OpenRewrite to automatically refactor and modernize these legacy systems, improving readability, maintainability,   and performance, all while minimizing the risk of introducing bugs.</li> <li>Integrates Seamlessly with Development Workflow:   OpenRewrite works well with Maven, Gradle, and other build tools, and can be easily integrated into continuous   integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This means developers don\u2019t have to change their workflow, and   refactoring can happen automatically as part of the regular development process.</li> <li>Customizable Refactoring for Specific Needs:   Sometimes, teams have specific requirements for refactoring that don\u2019t fit standard patterns. OpenRewrite allows   developers to write custom recipes tailored to their project\u2019s unique needs, enabling automatic, project-specific code   transformations that address edge cases or organizational standards.</li> <li>Future-Proofing Codebases:   By continuously applying OpenRewrite to a project, developers can ensure their codebase remains modern and adaptable   to future changes in the ecosystem. This reduces the need for large, disruptive refactorings down the line, allowing   for smoother, incremental updates.</li> <li>Improve Developer Productivity:   Developers want to focus on building new features and solving complex problems, not performing tedious refactorings.   By automating these tasks, OpenRewrite frees up time and mental energy, allowing developers to concentrate on   higher-value activities.</li> </ul>","tags":["How-To","Code

<code>pom.xml</code> in a maven Multi-Module repository so that the   configuration applies to   each module</p> <ul> <li>You might encounter some issues when running Open Sourced OpenRewrite plugin in Multi-module maven projects,   always refer Multi-Module Projects  for known   issues</li> <li>If your issue not listed there with solution, then please create ticket   on GitHub:issues</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>No Recipe or No Style is run unless explicitly turned on explicitly with setting either in pom.xml or in command line</p> </li> <li>Recipes are classified differently for Source and Test codes. Therefore, it is important to note that not all recipes   executed for test codes.</li> <li>The goals <code>rewrite:run</code> and <code>rewrite:dryRun</code> are configured to fork Maven's life cycle and are a better choice when   running recipes via a stand-alone goal (<code>mvn rewrite:run</code>) because this will trigger all the necessary life-cycle   goals   prior to running rewrite's plugin</li> <li>The goals <code>rewrite:runNoFork</code> and <code>rewrite:dryRunNoFork</code> are more efficient to use them within the context of an   integration build, as these will not cause duplicate life cycle phases to be called</li> <li>My Personnel recommendation, prefer maven phase <code>process-sources</code> for binding <code>run</code> or <code>runNoFork</code> execution,   therefore   making changes in source code performed before unit test and integration tests execution</li> <li>Prefer maven phase <code>prepare-package</code> for binding <code>dryRun</code> or <code>dryRunNoFork</code> execution,   therefore maven build failed early before time-consuming integration tests executed</li> <li>Always configure plugin to execute <code>dryRun</code> and make build fail if any changes exists to avoid adding any new findings</li> <li>Enabled config in such a way recipes applied only on developer workstation and not in CI environment to avoid   commiting unintended changes.</li> <li>Recommendation is always check changes and commit them manually after verification</li> <li>OpenRewrite IntelliJ Plugin really helps to organise and run   recipe in developer workstation</li> </ul>","tags":["How-To","Code Refactoring","Automation","Secure Coding","Clean Code","Java","Maven","latest"]},{"location":"improvements/code-health-improvements.html","title":"Improve Code Health &amp; Reduce Technical Debt","text":"","tags":["Improvements","Clean Code","Code Refactoring","Secure Coding","Automation"]},{"location":"improvements/code-health-improvements.html#auto-upgrade-dependencies","title":"Auto upgrade dependencies","text":"<ul> <li>Use automated bot to update your project dependencies automatically in order to catch up with latest versions.</li> <li>Renovate provides easy integration and flexible if your organisation use   it.
